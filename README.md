# kaggle

It's been a while since I've refreshed my Python and machine learning skillset. This repo is my attempt to retain (or regain) the skills and know-how that have been gathering dust for a few years. These one-off projects make use of kaggle datasets and competions to guide exploration in various topics. Notebooks may be fully fleshed out from EDA to competition submission, or, more likely, they will focus on tinkering with one or two specific concepts that sparked my curiosity.
